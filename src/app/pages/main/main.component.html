      Over the past 50 years - living memory for me - there has been a huge
      increase in obesity and chronic diseases.
    </p>
    <p>When I was at primary school, almost no one was fat.</p>
    <p>Yet the reasons given for this increase make no sense to me.</p>

      One theory is the 'thrifty gene hypothesis'. This states that humans have
      evolved with frequent food shortages and famines and so have adapted to
      put on weight in times of plenty so as to survive the next famine. Under
      this theory, the recent rise in obesity is because now, for the first time
      ever, we have enough food to eat and no famines, and so we just keep
      putting on weight. But this makes no sense to me. I can remember the time that very few people in the upper and middle classes of Britain were fat, and they all had enough to eat.

       I come from an affluent middle class family, went to a secondary school with mostly children from affluent families, and my parents had lots of friends who were also affluent. No one went hungry and very few were fat. People ate as much as they wanted and mostly stayed slim. The middle and upper classes in Britain have had enough to eat for generations and, until recently, mostly didn't get fat. If the Thrify Gene Hypothesis were right, the increase in obesity would have happened longer ago than just the last 40 or 50 years.
